What is NAntGraph?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NAntGraph is a documentation tool designed to make it easier to understand NAnt 
or Ant build files.

A common proverb reads A picture is worth a thousand words. In the computer 
field, we often find that one diagram is worth a thousand lines of code - or 
more.

In fact, a good diagram can make it much easier to understand the code - 
providing an easy entry point through which a reader may gain a high level 
understanding before approaching the code itself.

Based on GraphViz, NAntGraph depicts the structure of your build file targets 
and their dependencies as a directed graph.
